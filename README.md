 Favorite Scenes

1. **Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci) escape scene:** escaped prison and made their way to New York in an attempt to make the Big Apple their new stomping grounds. They find out about a donation drive happening at a big toy store, and when Kevin clocks on to what they’re doing, he follows them there and catches them in the act.
2. **Kevin sneakily finds himself staying in the most prestigious hotel in Manhattan:** The Plaza. Whilst staying there, he becomes familiar with the lobby staff – the concierge (Tim Curry), the bell boy (Rob Schnieder) and the desk clerk (Dana Ivey). The trio don’t believe that a 10 year old boy could be staying at The Plaza unsupervised, so they take it upon themselves to find out what’s going on.
